# Constraints

here are boundaries around our project.

## External

- the project deadline is only one week which is quit intense
- its quite challenging for members working in shifts/weekends to do more to
  contribution to the project

## Internal: Involuntary

- Time

  Members availability is different so each member indicate his availability in
  the timetable which is quite difficult to set an exact hour to meet

- Technology

- git commit -m '<category: do something; do some other things>'

ex

- git commit-m '<index.html:header:add links >'

  Members skills level is different that create us kind of barriers to achieve
  efficient creation also the the verity of Technologies used in this project is
  also challenging for some members, like the appropriate use of github / vscode
  /node.js /html and css
