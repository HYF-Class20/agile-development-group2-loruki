## Strategy vs. Board

### What parts of your plan went as expected?

- Dividing tasks. It makes work easier and each of us can focus on the tasks
  assigned </br>

### What parts of your plan did not work out?

- Some of us don't give an update or delayed the work that given, other member
  need to take over the task because we meet the deadline.
