# Communication

## Group Rules

In this group we respect each others. We says please and thank you. </br> We do
have a minor language barrier problem with one of the team member but it's not
stopping us to understand, do the best for the team and support each others.
</br> </br> We always have to attend the daily meeting with prepared topic and
updating our work to other members. </br> We have a strict rules that only
members with active contribution may stay in the group because we respect hard
work and dedication. </br>

## Asking for Help

There's a fine line between confidently learning from your mistakes, and
stubbornly getting no where. Here is a general guide for when to ask for help
based on how long you've been stuck on the same problem:

1. _0 -> 30 min_: Try on your own
2. _30 -> 60 min_: Ask your group for help
3. _60+ min_: Tag your coaches in Slack or GitHub
